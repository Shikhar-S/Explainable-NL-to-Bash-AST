# Tellina baseline for [NLC2CMD Challenge](http://nlc2cmd.us-east.mybluemix.net/) @ [NeurIPS 2020](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/CompetitionTrack)

This code integrates [Tellina](http://kirin.cs.washington.edu:8000/developers) as a baseline for the NLC2CMD challenge. Participants can use this code as a reference to integrate their own methods, or to build on top of the Tellina code. 

The entire Tellina code resides in [src/submission_code](./src/submission_code) folder, and the [`main.py`](./src/submission_code/main.py) file serves as the interface between Tellina and the evaluation code.


See the submission [README](../submission-code/README.md) to start a fresh submission or for instructions on submitting to the challenge.
