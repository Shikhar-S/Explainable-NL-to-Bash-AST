:arrow_down: *Get the code by either cloning this repo or through the link: [https://ibm.box.com/v/bashlint-code](https://ibm.box.com/v/bashlint-code)*

This submodule is a bash command parser which augments the [bashlex](https://github.com/idank/bashlex) tool with utility-flag, utility-argument and flag-argument edges. 

_The parser cannot parse the following code structures._
1. Multi-statement code blocks.


### Installation:
```
pip install -r requirements.txt
```


### Test the parser in a python shell:

```python
from bashlint import data_tools

cmd = 'find . -name "*.txt" -print | less'
cmd_ast = data_tools.bash_parser(cmd)

data_tools.pretty_print(cmd_ast)
```

### Output:
The parser outputs the AST structure of the input bash command. By default the arguments in the command are replaced by their types.
```
ROOT()
    PIPELINE()
        UTILITY(find)
            ARGUMENT(.)<Path>
            FLAG(-name)
                ARGUMENT("*.txt")<Regex>
            FLAG(-print)
        UTILITY(less)
 ```
