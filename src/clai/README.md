# [NLC2CMD Challenge](http://ibm.biz/nlc2cmd) @ [NeurIPS 2020](https://neurips.cc/Conferences/2020/CompetitionTrack)


The NLC2CMD Competition brings the power of natural language processing to the command line. You are tasked with building models that can transform descriptions of command line tasks in English to their Bash syntax.

## Updates

- **August  3, 2020** - We identified some examples in the original NL2Bash data which had syntactic issues, bash parser incompatibility, etc. resulting in invalid Bash commands for the competition. We've fixed this and updated the dataset [[link](./docs/nl2bash-data.md)]. Please update your local copy of the `NL2Bash dataset` and also update your local copy of `submission-code` folder with the one available in this branch.
